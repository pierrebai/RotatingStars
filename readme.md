# Rotating Stars

After watching the rotating polygons video on the Mathologer YouTube channel,
I decided to write this Python program to generate such animations.

For the command-line version, all you need is a recent Python interpreter.
I used Python 3.7.8, but a more recent one should work too.

For the Qt version, you will need to install the required dependencies.
Here are some instructions explaining what and how to install what is needed:

- Python 3.7+: download and install from https://www.python.org/downloads/
- Clone the git repository: enter the command ```git clone https://github.com/pierrebai/RotatingStars.git```
- pipenv: isolate Python dependencies in a virtual environment: enter the command ```pip install pipenv```
- Qt libraries: enter the command ```pipenv install```
- Run the program: enter the command ```pipenv run python main_qt.py```

Here is how the user interface in the Qt program looks:
